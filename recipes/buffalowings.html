        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken wings</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Buffalo sauce</li>
            <li>Stone House Seasoning</li>
            <li>Blue Cheese Dressing - optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I preheat my oven and then line a baking sheet with parchment or foil and then arrange a wire rack on top of the lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>For the next step, I whisk together my cornstarch and Stone House Seasoning and then pour it over my chicken wings. Then, I lightly toss the chicken wings in the cornstarch mixture to make sure they are well coated. Since we aren’t frying the chicken wings, the cornstarch serves to help make the chicken wings have a nice crispy, crunchy crust on the outside when they bake.</li>
            <li>Then, I bake my chicken wings until the skin is crispy. This usually takes about 50 minutes. I then remove them from the wire rack and toss them in my buffalo sauce. For those who like their buffalo chicken wings wet with sauce, they are ready to be served. For those like me that like a drier buffalo chicken wing, I return them to the oven for another 5 to 8 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>To serve them, place them onto a platter and serve them with blue cheese dressing or ranch dressing for dipping! They are perfect for parties, get-togethers, watching games, and even enjoying as a meal if you like!</li>
