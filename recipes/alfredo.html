            <strong>The Best Homemade Alfredo Sauce</strong>  is rich, creamy, and delicious! This Alfredo Sauce recipe is quick and easy to make!

            <h2> What is Alfredo Sauce?</h2>
            <p>Traditional Alfredo is a simple, rich, creamy Italian pasta sauce typically made from butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese.</p>

            <p>It is traditionally served over fettuccini but can be served with other kinds of pasta and chicken, shrimp, steak, or vegetables. </p>

            <p>Some recipes may thicken it with flour, making it similar to a white sauce, but my recipe does not use flour. This makes my recipe gluten-free when made following the recipe with no substitutions. This recipe thickens beautifully as written, due to the creamy dairy and cheeses and the low, slow cooking.</p>
